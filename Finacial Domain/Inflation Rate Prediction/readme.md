# Inflation Rate Prediction

This project predicts the inflation rate using various economic indicators such as GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, interest rate, and money supply. The project includes data generation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and a Streamlit web application for visualization.

## Dataset Generation

The dataset is generated synthetically and includes the following features:
- Date
- GDP Growth Rate
- Unemployment Rate
- Interest Rate
- Money Supply
- Inflation Rate

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA includes:
- Time series plots of the economic indicators
- Correlation matrix to show relationships between features

## Machine Learning

A Random Forest Regressor is used to predict the inflation rate. The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Streamlit Web Application

A Streamlit web application is provided to visualize the data and predictions. The app includes:
- EDA section with time series plots and correlation matrix
- ML section with model evaluation and prediction plots
