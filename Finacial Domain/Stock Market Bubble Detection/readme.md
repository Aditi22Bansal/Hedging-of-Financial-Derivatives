# Stock Market Bubble Detection

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The main goal of this project is to develop models to detect stock market bubbles using three different deep learning algorithms: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The aim is to identify bubbles effectively.

## ðŸ§µ Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `stock_market_bubble.csv`, which contains synthetic stock market data with features like date, price, volume, volatility, and a binary label indicating if the market is in a bubble.

## ðŸ§¾ Description
This project involves the implementation of three different deep learning algorithms for stock market bubble detection: RNN, CNN, and MLP. Each model is trained to identify patterns in the stock market data and detect bubbles.

## ðŸ§® What I had done!
1. Generated a synthetic dataset of stock market data.
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and characteristics.
3. Implemented three different models: RNN, CNN, and MLP.
4. Trained and evaluated each model.
5. Compared the models based on their accuracy scores.

## ðŸš€ Models Implemented
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** A basic neural network architecture used for classification tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** An LSTM-based RNN model used for sequential data analysis.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A 1D CNN model used for pattern recognition in sequential data.

## ðŸ“š Libraries Needed
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis Results
- Basic dataset information and statistics.
- Distribution of stock prices, volumes, and volatilities.
- Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.
- Visualization of bubbles vs non-bubbles in stock prices, volumes, and volatilities.
